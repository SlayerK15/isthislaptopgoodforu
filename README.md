# Laptop Research & Analysis Platform

A comprehensive platform to crawl, analyze, and recommend laptops based on user preferences.

## Project Structure

The platform consists of four interconnected applications:

### 1. [Laptop Dashboard](https://github.com/SlayerK15/laptop_analyzer) 
- Frontend web application for visualizing laptop data
- Interactive user interface for comparing specifications 
- Built with React and Node.js
- Status: ðŸš§ Work in Progress

### 2. [Laptop Analyzer](https://github.com/SlayerK15/laptop_analyzer)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing engine
- Standardizes and validates crawled data
- Prepares clean dataset for dashboard and recommender(currently manaul)
- Status: âœ… Complete

### 3. [Laptop Crawler](https://github.com/SlayerK15/Laptop_Crawler)
- Web scraping tool for collecting laptop data
- Extracts specifications from online retailers
- Built with Python
- Status: âœ… Complete

### 4. Laptop Recommender
- AI-powered recommendation system 
- Suggests laptops based on user requirements
- Uses cleaned data from analyzer
- Status: ðŸš§ In Development

## Data Pipeline
